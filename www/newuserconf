<p>The confirmation email is required as part of the activation process,
to verify that you own the email account you supplied.  We just attempted
to send you this message, but unfortunately the attempt failed.  Please
check that the email address you supplied is formatted correctly.  If
you need to make any changes, use your browser's Back button to return
to the registration page.

<p>If the email address you entered looks right, the problem might be
something wrong at our end.  You might want to wait a little while and
try again.  If that doesn't help, please <a
